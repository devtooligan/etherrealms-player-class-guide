## Artificer-Optimizoor

*Virtuosos of magical optimization, these maestros can reduce a spell's mana consumption to the point where even a novice could cast it effortlessly. Their knowledge of ancient opcodes, bit summoning techniques, and the hidden mysteries of the Etherrealm enables them to simplify even the most arcane of incantations. Most operate in solitude, some go insane, but if a mana mechanic joins your ranks, your party's destined to be based.*

## Berserker-Huffoor

*Their magic is raw and untamed, based on the arcane language of Huff and drawing power from the very chaos of the Etherrealms. Some say they are mad; others claim they possess a clarity most can never attain. One thing is certain, when a Huffoor enters the fray, they plunge headfirst into the heart of chaos, wielding low-level incantations with fierce abandon.*

## Druid-ZK Engineer

Guardians of the veiled mysteries of the very foundation of the Etherrealms, these druids channel the ancient energies of zero knowledge. They weave obfuscating incantations, ensuring secrets remain untouched and truths are discerned without revelation. While many wander the digital forests solo, the whispers of their craft echo, promising untold power to those who seek their expertise.

## Warrior-Auditor

#### Mercenary Sellsword-Auditor

*Be not tied to one banner but offer thine skills to the highest bidder, engaging in various audit quests across the realm. Freedom accompanies thy work, but with it, uncertainty of constant gold.*

#### Lone Blade Auditor

*Solo audits are thy calling. Though security is thy sword, marketing and self-promotion â€” is thy shield. Part bard by necessity, be known, and let the realm seek thee for thy services.*

## Ranger-Bounty Hunter

*These lone wolves, who sometimes hunt in packs, may live off the land for long stretches then find an elusive bug and claim a king's reward. But fortunes are unpredictable, bewares dear fren.  Some rewards promise gold but deliver tin.*
